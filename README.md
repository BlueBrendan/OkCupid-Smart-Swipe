##Preface
The OkCupid Smart Swiper is a sophisticated automation tool designed to automate profile swiping on OkCupid, the online dating platform. Rather than swiping right on all profiles like most bots, the OkCupid Smart Swiper uses various details on a profile like the match percentage, image count, bio word count, and question count to make a swiping decision 

##Requirements
To use the OkCupid Smart Swiper, you must have
1. A Windows PC (there currently is no version available for MacOS)
2. The Firefox web browser (the swiper launches an automated instance of Firefox to perform swiping)
3. An OkCupid account and its login credentials

##Setup
1. Download the OkCupid Smart Swiper from *google drive link*
2. Start the application by double clicking OkCupid Smart Swiper.exe
3. Set the parameters to taste (the defaults are 95% match percentage, 3 images, 100 words, and 100 questions)
4. Click the "Start Swiping" button
5. Wait for the automated browser to launch (this may prompt a firewall warning on first startup, click allow)
6. Login with your OkCupid account credentials and click the "I've reached the homescreen" button to begin the automation procedure (this is required every time the automated web browser restarts)
7. Once swiping has completed, the Smart Swiper will provide a summary of the results, including all profiles that were swiped right on. You can visit these profiles individually and decide whether to send an intro or to pass on them
8. If you want to swipe (with the exact same settings), click "Swipe Again". Otherwise, click "OK". This will close the web browser and return you to the main window. Note that you will be required to login again on the next session.

##Dependencies
The OkCupid Smart Swiper is written in Python and uses Tkinter, Python's standard out-of-the-box graphical interface. Selenium is used for web browser interaction
